      <h1>What is Depression?</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Depression (major depressive disorder) is a widespread and significant medical condition that has a negative impact on how you feel, think, and behave. It is also, thankfully, treatable. Depression produces unhappiness and/or a loss of interest in previously appreciated activities. It can cause a slew of mental and physical issues, as well as a reduction in your capacity to operate at work and at home.</h5>

<h1>There are 3 types of depression</h1>
<h1>Major Depression</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">You may hear your doctor refer to this as "major depressive disorder," and you may have it if you are depressed for the majority of the week.</p>
<p class="w3-text-black">Some other symptoms you might have are:</p>

<p class="w3-text-black">* Trouble getting to sleep or feeling sleepy during the day</p>

<p class="w3-text-black">* Being tired and without energy</p>

<p class="w3-text-black">* Feeling worthless or guilty.</h5>

    </div>

    <div class="w3-twothird">
      <h1>Bipolar Disorder</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Some people refer to this as "manic depression," because it is easy to switch moods from high energy with a "up" mood to low "depressive" mood. For a small percentage of people with bipolar disorder, some traditional antidepressants may increase the risk of causing a "high" phase of illness, or increasing the frequency of having more episodes over time.
</h5>

<h1>Situational Depression</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">In psychiatry, this isn't a technical term. However, you can be depressed if you're having problems coping with a severe event in your life, such as a family death, divorce, or job loss. This is known as "stress response syndrome" by your doctor.

      <h1>Trigger warning: Suicide</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">If you’re having suicidal thoughts</h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-.2">You're not alone, no matter how much pain you're in right now. Many of us have contemplated suicide at some point in our lives. Suicidal ideation is not a character flaw, and it does not imply that you are insane, weak, or flawed. It simply indicates you're in more pain than you can handle right now. However, with time and assistance, you will be able to conquer your problems, and the anguish and suicidal thoughts will fade away.
</h5>

<p class="w3-text-black">* Always remember that your feelings are valid</p>

<p class="w3-text-black">* You are love, Worth it and a person</p>

<p class="w3-text-black">* There are many things you can still accomplish in your life.</p>

<p class="w3-text-black">* Don’t be afraid to reach out</h5>
